project
  files (may be in folders)

topParser
  packName
  aliasings
  Map<name,String> topDecls

Phase 1: run the topParser for all the files
there is a special file without package (may be with special name) that has global aliases
Phase 2: merge all the packages maps with the same name
  in this phase we merge all the aliases in the same pachages and the global aliases
  in this phase we add implicit aliases for all the classes defined in that package
  
Then we parse each topDec independently,
with its own alias map that is used during parser
