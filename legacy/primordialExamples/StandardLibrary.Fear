//Either
//LList (shallow imm)
//List as a headed LList
//Stream as wrapper over List
//Stream.map/filter as all terminal operations
All of those need to work with mut/imm and read.
Collections stuff need to work with
1 imm imm
2 readOnly imm
3 mut imm

//NO imm readOnly == imm imm c1
4 readOnly read
//NO mut read

//NO imm mut ==imm imm c2
//NO readOnly mut == readOnly readOnly c3
5 mut mut
